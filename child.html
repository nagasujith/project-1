    <h1>Nutrition for kids Guidelines for a healthy diet</h1>
    <h2>You want your child to eat healthy foods, but do you know which nutrients are needed and in what amounts?<br> Here's
        a quick overview.</h2>
    <p>
        Children (Ages 0 to 10) Nutritional Promotion

Providing a balanced and nutrient-rich food is crucial to ensuring the well-being and healthy development of children aged 0 to 10. <br>This journey requires a variety of essential vitamins, each of which has a distinct role in enhancing growth, cognitive function, and general vitality.<br>
Vitamin A, found in colourful vegetables like carrots, sweet potatoes, and leafy greens, supports vision and immunity.<br> Citrus fruits, strawberries, and bell peppers are high in vitamin C, a powerful antioxidant that strengthens defences and promotes tissue regeneration.<br>
Vitamin D, also known as the sunshine vitamin, is found in fatty fish and fortified dairy products and helps to strengthen bones and protect against sickness. <br>Vitamin E, found in nuts and seeds, promotes cellular health and aids the immune system.<br>
Vitamin K is found in leafy greens, broccoli, and Brussels sprouts, and it helps with blood clotting and bone health. Thiamine to B12 are all present in lean meats, whole grains, and eggs, and they help with metabolism, energy production, and neurological functioning.
Indulge in nature's palette with nutrient-dense options ranging from the regal colours of carrots and berries to the nourishing embrace of fish and legumes. Every plate can be a canvas for an artist, creating a tapestry of health for the coming years. Cultivating these nutritious options is the foundation for a lifetime of well-being.
