    <h1>Child Nutrition</h1>

    <div class="section">
        <h2>Introduction to Child Nutrition</h2>
        <div class="info-box">
            <p>Child nutrition is a vital aspect of a child's overall health and development. Proper nutrition during
                early childhood is essential for growth, cognitive development, immune function, and establishing
                healthy eating habits that can last a lifetime.</p>
            <p>The nutritional needs of children are unique, as their bodies are rapidly growing and developing.
                Nutrients such as vitamins, minerals, protein, carbohydrates, and healthy fats play critical roles in
                supporting physical growth, cognitive function, and immune system strength.</p>
            <p>A well-balanced diet for children should include a variety of foods from different food groups. Fruits,
                vegetables, whole grains, lean proteins, and dairy products are important sources of essential
                nutrients. It's crucial to provide a range of nutrients to support children's energy needs and optimize
                their health.</p>
            <p>Childhood is also a crucial time to establish healthy eating patterns. Introducing a wide range of foods
                early on can help prevent picky eating behaviors and create a foundation for diverse food preferences.
                It's important to encourage children to try new foods and explore different tastes and textures.</p>
            <p>Additionally, hydration is key to maintaining good health. Children need an adequate intake of water
                throughout the day to support bodily functions, especially as they become more active.</p>
            <p>As children's dietary needs vary depending on their age, activity level, and growth stage, consulting
                with healthcare professionals and registered dietitians can provide personalized guidance to ensure
                optimal nutrition and development.</p>

        <h2>Healthy Food Choices</h2>
        <div class="info-box">
            <p>Choosing healthy foods for children is essential to provide the necessary nutrients for growth,
                development, and overall well-being. Here are some key healthy food choices to include in your child's
                diet:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Fruits and Vegetables:</strong> Incorporate a variety of colorful fruits and vegetables.
                    They are rich in vitamins, minerals, and antioxidants that support immune function and overall
                    health.</li>
                <li><strong>Whole Grains:</strong> Opt for whole grains like whole wheat, brown rice, and oats. These
                    provide fiber and sustained energy for active children.</li>
                <li><strong>Lean Proteins:</strong> Include lean protein sources such as lean meats, poultry, fish,
                    eggs, beans, and legumes. Protein is essential for muscle growth and repair.</li>
                <li><strong>Dairy or Dairy Alternatives:</strong> Offer low-fat or fat-free dairy products, or
                    fortified dairy alternatives like soy or almond milk, for calcium and vitamin D.</li>
                <li><strong>Healthy Fats:</strong> Choose sources of healthy fats like avocados, nuts, seeds, and
                    olive oil. Healthy fats support brain development and overall health.</li>
                <li><strong>Limit Added Sugars:</strong> Minimize sugary snacks, beverages, and desserts. Instead, opt
                    for natural sources of sweetness like fresh fruits.</li>
                <li><strong>Hydration:</strong> Encourage water as the primary beverage. Limit sugary drinks and
                    juices.</li>

                    high in unhealthy fats, salt, and added sugars.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Remember that children's taste preferences and nutritional needs evolve over time. Creating a positive
                eating environment and involving children in meal preparation can encourage them to develop a love for
                healthy foods.</p>

            <ul>
                <li><strong>Offer Variety:</strong> Introduce a variety of foods from different food groups. This helps
                    expand your child's palate and exposes them to new flavors.</li>
                <li><strong>Be Patient:</strong> It may take multiple tries for a child to accept a new food. Be patient
                    and avoid pressuring them to eat.</li>
                <li><strong>Model Healthy Eating:</strong> Set a positive example by eating a variety of healthy foods
                    yourself. Children are more likely to try foods they see their caregivers enjoying.</li>
                <li><strong>Involve Children:</strong> Let children help with meal planning and preparation. They may
                    be more willing to eat foods they've helped prepare.</li>
                <li><strong>Create Positive Mealtime Atmosphere:</strong> Make mealtimes pleasant and relaxed. Avoid
                    power struggles or negative comments about food.</li>
                <li><strong>Offer Small Portions:</strong> Start with small portions of new foods. This reduces the
                    pressure and makes trying new foods less overwhelming.</li>
                <li><strong>Be Creative:</strong> Present foods in creative ways. Use cookie cutters to make fun shapes
                    or arrange foods in colorful patterns.</li>

                    encouraging them to try new things.</li>
                <li><strong>Set a Routine:</strong> Establish regular meal and snack times to create a predictable
                    eating schedule.</li>
